## General info
This iOS application was developed with Swift, Firebase and Xcode aims to encourage people to purchase greener products with a robust rewarding system. 

When shopping at the supermarket, users can scan the QR code on the label of each product to get product details, such as their green points. After each shopping session, users can scan the QR code on the receipt to collect green points to their Eco Rewards account. This green points collecting mechanism was predefined with 18 different tasks targeting at three different types of users who shop daily, shop in bulk and willing to buy greener products. Users are able to redeem rewards with their green points, those rewards are provided by our sponsor companies which want to promote their newly released green products. Eco Rewards also provides leaderboard and earning history to let users check their ranking and shopping history.
